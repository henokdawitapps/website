    <p>When I speak of "my," "me," and "I," I mean Henok Dawit. When I speak of "the spherocolor app" I mean the spherocolor application.</p>
    <p>
                  I built the spherocolor app as
                  an Ad Supported app. The spherocolor app is provided by
                  me at no cost and is intended for use as
                  is.
                </p> <p>
                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information if anyone decided to use the spherocolor app.
                </p> <p>
                  If you choose to use the spherocolor app, then you agree to
                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy.
                </p> <p>
                  The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                  as in my Terms and Conditions, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p><div><p>
                    The spherocolor app does use third party services that may collect
                    information used to identify you.

                  <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
                  <p>I want to inform you that whenever you
                  use the spherocolor app, in a case of an error in the spherocolor app
                  I collect data and information (through third party
                  products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                  include information such as your device Internet Protocol
                  (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
                  configuration of the spherocolor app when utilizing the spherocolor app,
                  the time and date of your use of the spherocolor app, and other
                  statistics.</p>
                  <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                  stored on your device's internal memory. </p>
                  <p>The spherocolor app does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                  the spherocolor app may use third party code and libraries that use
                  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                  You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
                  and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
                  choose to refuse my cookies, you may not be able to use some
                  portions of the spherocolor app.
                </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
                  I may employ third-party companies and
                  individuals due to the following reasons:
                </p> <ul><li>To facilitate the spherocolor app;</li> <li>To provide the spherocolor app on my behalf;</li> <li>To perform service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist me in analyzing how the spherocolor app is used.</li></ul> <p>
                  I want to inform users of the spherocolor app
                  that these third parties have access to your Personal
                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                  them on my behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                  disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  I value your trust in providing me your
                  Personal Information, thus I am striving to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.
                </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                  The spherocolor app may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by me.
                  Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                  Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                  no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
                  privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
                  services.
                </p> <p><strong>Childrens Privacy</strong></p> <p>
                  The spherocolor app does not address anyone under the age of 13.
                  I do not knowingly collect personally
                  identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                  me with personal information, I immediately
                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                  and you are aware that your child has provided me with
                  personal information, please contact me so that
                  I will be able to do necessary actions.
                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update our Privacy Policy from
                  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes. I will
                  notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                  this page.
