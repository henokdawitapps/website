                  By downloading or using the calculator app, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the calculator app. You’re not
                  allowed to copy, or modify the calculator app, any part of the calculator app, or
                  our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                  extract the source code of the calculator app, and you also shouldn’t try
                  to translate the calculator app into other languages, or make derivative
                  versions. The calculator app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                  database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                  to it, still belong to Henok Dawit.
                </p> <p>
                  I am committed to ensuring that the calculator app is
                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I
                  reserve the right to make changes to the calculator app or to charge for
                  its services, at any time and for any reason.
                </p><div><p>
                    The calculator app does use third party services that declare their own
                    Terms and Conditions.
                  </p> <p>
                    Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service
                    providers used by the calculator app
                  </p> <ul><li><a class="strong color" href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms">Google AdMob</a></li></ul></div> <p>
                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
                  I will not take responsibility for. Certain
                  functions of the calculator app will require the calculator app to have an active
                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                  by your mobile network provider, but I
                  cannot take responsibility for the calculator app not working at full
                  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                  have any of your data allowance left.
                </p> <p></p> <p>
                  If you’re using the calculator app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the calculator app, or
                  other third party charges. In using the calculator app, you’re accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the calculator app outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                  using the calculator app, please be aware that I assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the calculator app.
                </p> <p>
                  Along the same lines, I cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the calculator app i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the service,
                  I cannot accept responsibility.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to my responsibility for your
                  use of the calculator app, when you’re using the calculator app, it’s important to
                  bear in mind that although I endeavour to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, I do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to me so that I can make it available
                  to you. From time to time, I may change or remove features of the calculator app. I accept no liability for any
                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                  relying wholly on this functionality of the calculator app.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, I may wish to update the calculator app. The calculator app is
                  currently available on iOS – the requirements for
                  system(and for any additional systems I
                  decide to extend the availability of the calculator app to) may change,
                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                  using the calculator app. I do not promise that it
                  will always update the calculator app so that it is relevant to you
                  and/or works with the iOS version that you have
                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                  accept updates to the calculator application when offered to you, I may
                  also wish to stop providing the calculator app, and may terminate use of
                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                  Unless I tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                  (b) you must stop using the calculator app, and (if needed) delete it
                  from your device.
                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
