    <p>When I speak of "my," "me," and "I," I mean Henok Dawit.</p> <p>
                  By downloading or using the SpheroColor app, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you. You should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the SpheroColor app. You're not
                  allowed to copy, or modify the SpheroColor app, any part of the SpheroColor app, or
                  our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to
                  extract the source code of the SpheroColor app, and you also shouldn't try
                  to translate the SpheroColor app into other languages, or make derivative
                  versions. The SpheroColor app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                  database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                  to it, still belong to Henok Dawit.
                </p> <p>
                  I am committed to ensuring that the SpheroColor app is
                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I
                  reserve the right to make changes to the SpheroColor app or to charge for
                  its services, at any time and for any reason.
                </p><div><p>
                    The SpheroColor app does use third party services that declare their own
                    Terms and Conditions.

                    providers used by the SpheroColor app

                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
                  I will not take responsibility for. Certain
                  functions of the SpheroColor app will require the SpheroColor app to have an active
                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                  by your mobile network provider, but I
                  cannot take responsibility for the SpheroColor app not working at full
                  functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't
                  have any of your data allowance left.
                </p> <p></p> <p>
                  If you're using the SpheroColor app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the SpheroColor app, or
                  other third party charges. In using the SpheroColor app, you're accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the SpheroColor app outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you're
                  using the SpheroColor app, please be aware that I assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the SpheroColor app.
                </p> <p>
                  Along the same lines, I cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the SpheroColor app i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged - if it runs out of
                  battery and you can't turn it on to avail the service,
                  I cannot accept responsibility.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to my responsibility for your
                  use of the SpheroColor app, when you're using the SpheroColor app, it's important to
                  bear in mind that although I endeavour to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, I do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to me so that I can make it available
                  to you. From time to time, I may change or remove features of the SpheroColor app. I accept no liability for any
                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                  relying wholly on this functionality of the SpheroColor app.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, I may wish to update the SpheroColor app. The SpheroColor app is
                  currently available on iOS - the requirements for
                  system(and for any additional systems I
                  decide to extend the availability of the SpheroColor app to) may change,
                  and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                  using the SpheroColor app. I do not promise that it
                  will always update the SpheroColor app so that it is relevant to you
                  and/or works with the iOS version that you have
                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                  accept updates to the SpheroColor application when offered to you, I may
                  also wish to stop providing the SpheroColor app, and may terminate use of
                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                  Unless I tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                  (b) you must stop using the SpheroColor app, and (if needed) delete it
                  from your device.
                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
